* how to
** ~create~ a task
#+begin_src sh
task add "water flowers"
#+end_src
** add ~tags~

#+begin_src sh
task add +home "water flowers"
task add +home +work "meal"
#+end_src

** add ~priority~ of a task
#+begin_src sh
task add pri:H "task one"   # high priority
task add pri:M "task two"   # medium priority
task add pri:L "task three" # low priority
#+end_src
** ~annotate~ the task

this helps to describe task more

#+begin_src sh
task 1 annotate "your annotation here"
#+end_src

** ~modify~ the task

Let's say we have a task like this;

#+begin_src sh
task add "water flowers" pri:H
#+end_src

And we want to modify the *priority* of it later. we use *mod* with task ID

#+begin_src sh
task mod 1 pri:L
#+end_src

** ~edit~ task with a text editor

you need to know the ID of the task

#+begin_src sh
task 1 edit
#+end_src
** ~undo~ changes

this will show the *diff* between current and previos change. answer yes or no to commit

#+begin_src bash
task undo
#+end_src
** ~clean deleted~ tasks

*task* does not delete *deleted tasks*. you need to clean them separately

#+begin_src sh
task purge
#+end_src
** filter tasks

* concepts
