+ also called *gnu privacy guard*
+ this is a key which helps to encrypt and decript files
+ there are 2 types of gpg keys;
1. private : unlocks everything you lock with that
2. public : you send to other people
+ gpg keys _expire_ ! so you need to generate them once or twice a year
** how to
*** generate a gpg key
1. first generate personal key:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
gpg --full-gen-key
   #+END_SRC
2. choose *RSA and RSA*
3. choose *4096* for maximum security
4. choose *y = 1* to make the key expire in one year
5. enter your *real name and surname*
6. enter your *email*
7. confirm
8. enter a password. this is the password of your key. _DON'T FORGET IT_

*** encrypt files with gpg
1. navigate to directory you want to encrypt (here I generate a random file)
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo "secret message" > ~/secret-file.txt
   #+END_SRC

2. encrypt the file
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
# -r : recepient (in this case me)
# -e : file to encrypt
gpg -r your_mail@provider.com -e secret-file.txt
   #+END_SRC
   after this command, a file with *gpg* extension will be created. so now you can put this file (*secret-file.txt.gpg*) on the internet and no one will know what it is

3. remove the original file (optional)
   + basic remove
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
rm secret-file.txt
   #+END_SRC

   + deep remove (more secure)
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
shred -u secret-file.txt
   #+END_SRC

*** decrypt files with gpg
1. decrypt command
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
gpg -d secret-file.txt
   #+END_SRC
2. then enter the password of your *gpg key*. the password you entered while [[generate a gpg key][generating]] the key
