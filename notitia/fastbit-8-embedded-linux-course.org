* Chapter 1
** Using Minicom

+ ~fact~ for Linux, the best *serial monitoring software* is [[./minicom.org][minicom]]

+ ~fact~ when a device does not have a display or not connected to the LAN we can use *serial monitoring software* to communicate/control the device over USB cable

+ ~howto~ detect serial device and connect to it using minicom;

  1. open a terminal

  2. watch dmesg output for *usb*

     #+begin_src sh
while true; do sudo dmesg | grep -e usb -e cdc_acm; sleep 1; clear; done
     #+end_src

  3. plug the *device* (/beagle bone black/ for example)

     if you are patient enough you will see something like this after a while;

  4. take *cdc_acm* string ("ttyACM0" in this example)

  5. fireup *minicom* as sudo with -s option and select "Serial Port Setup"

     #+begin_src sh
sudo minicom -s
     #+end_src

  6. Press 'A' to modify *Serial Device*

  7. delete the string here and type cdc_acm string instead. then press *Enter*

  8. Press *ESC* and save it as *dfl*

  9. exit
