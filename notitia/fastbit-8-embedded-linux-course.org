#+TITLE: Fastbit 8 Embedded Linux Course

* Chapter 1
** Using Minicom

+ ~fact~ for Linux, the best *serial monitoring software* is [[./minicom.org][minicom]]

+ ~fact~ when a device does not have a display or not connected to the LAN we can use *serial monitoring software* to communicate/control the device over USB cable

+ ~howto~ detect serial device and connect to it using minicom;

  1. open a terminal

  2. watch dmesg output for *usb*

     #+begin_src sh
while true; do sudo dmesg | grep -e usb -e cdc_acm; sleep 1; clear; done
     #+end_src

  3. plug the *device* (/beagle bone black/ for example)

     if you are patient enough you will see something like this after a while;

  4. take *cdc_acm* string ("ttyACM0" in this example)

  5. fireup *minicom* as sudo with -s option and select "Serial Port Setup"

     #+begin_src sh
sudo minicom -s
     #+end_src

  6. Press 'A' to modify *Serial Device*

  7. delete the string here and type cdc_acm string instead. then press *Enter*

  8. Press *ESC* and save it as *dfl*

  9. exit
** Getting Started with BBB

+ ~fact~ Beaglebone Black comes with a *Debian* based linux distrobution

+ ~fact~ Built-in linux distrobution is stored inside a hardware component called *eMMS*

+ ~fact~ Beaglebone Black specs
  - 4GB eMMS /(flash)/ + SD Card slot
  - 2 x 200MHz ARM7 processors
  - 512MB DDR3 Ram
  - 8 PWM outputs
  - 7 12-bit ADC

+ ~fact~ BBB supports *Ethernet Over USB* but you need a driver on your host OS side to get this work

+ ~fact~ whenever you see something like *usb0*, *usb1* in =ifconfig= output, know that this devices supports *Ethernet Over USB*

+ ~howto~ Enable *Ethernet over USB*

  + Target Configurations:

    1. Make sure the device is connected via USB cable to your HOST

    2. type =ifconfig= and see if there are some interfaces like *usb0* or *usb1*. if they are not available then =reboot= the device

    3. Go to host and type =ifconfig=. now you should see a new interface like *enp0s20f0u3*. This is the interface which lets us to use *Enternet over USB*. Copy the ip number of this interface with the following command

       #+begin_src sh
ifconfig | grep -A 1 enp | grep inet | awk '{ print $2 }' | xsel -b
       #+end_src

    4. Now come back to target and ping this address by

       #+begin_src sh
ping PASTE_IP_HERE
       #+end_src

       There should be a connection. If pinging is working then everythings okay. pinging google.com is not gonna work because we didn't set DNS and gateway

    5. set DNS on target

       #+begin_src sh
vim /etc/resolv.conf
       #+end_src

       enter the following;

       #+begin_src txt
nameserer 8.8.8.8
nameserer 8.8.4.4
       #+end_src
