Hey I'm Oleksiy! I do digital electronics, Linux sysadmin, c/c++ dev, x86, ARM, os development, embedded systems and everything bare-metal! I'm a Computer Engineering student in Turkey. My interests are mostly between hardware and software. Contact me from [Telegram](https://t.me/savolla92) or freenode to talk about geeky stuff! **savolla** is my username on freenode
